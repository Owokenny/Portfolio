## Recommendation
- If PODHA are to stick with just one campaign source, the most profitable is Google ads, not totally ignoring the revenue that come from other campaign source like Meta ads and Yt campaign

## Data Limitation and caveat
- **Data completeness:** There isnt any supporting Data as regard the cost spent on each marketing campaign  which could have painted a better picture on the Return on investment from each campaign source.
- **Data context:** Insights are based on synthetic Data and may not account for real world variables
